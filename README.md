# Oleander

My MSc Thesis called _The online organization of people across multiple communication channels_. It's pretty theoretical, but includes proof of concept - a web app for creating event pages automatically on multiple services.

## Why Oleander?

Because of one internal joke from our Tuesday's [sauna](http://www.sauna-drobneho.cz/) sessions.

## Installation

It's described in _appendix E_ of the document. See PDF link below.

## Thesis document

You can read my thesis by downloading a [PDF file](https://github.com/downloads/honzajavorek/oleander/thesis.pdf) here from GitHub. By the way, it has [it's own page](https://is.muni.cz/th/208013/fi_m?info=1;zpet=%2Fvyhledavani%2F%3Fsearch%3Djavorek%26start%3D1) at Masaryk University's information system.

### Initial instructions

_(quick & dirty translation)_

1. Study the topic of common organization of small groups of people over the internet. Focus on tools and services used for communication and organization.
2. Based on research, suggest a solution how to connect popular services so people could communicate and share organizational information even without using the same platform.
3. Elaborate in detail every such case of inter-connection and find solutions, which are the most natural and usable ones (think about message threads, their synchronization between all systems, etc.).
4. If you find some solutions impracticable, explain why.
5. Realize demostrative application of described features.
6. Sum up perspectives and other possible applications of such solution. Think about possibilities of other connections.

### Abstract

_(copy & paste from document)_

This thesis explores the possibilities of creating a web system which would help to organize a small group of people, no matter what communication methods its members prefer. The paper first analyses common forms of computer-mediated communication and relations between these forms and their users. On this basis, the problem of interoperability across individual systems is formulated and hypotheses about feasibility and usefulness of the system are raised. The second half of the thesis deals with verification of raised hypotheses and specifies the form of a prototype in accordance with previous findings - an events managing tool. The last chapters describe the design of this tool and the implementation process.
